# Custour Brand Guidelines: The Tropical Modernity Edition

> [!NOTE]
> These guidelines are a living document designed to help us build a brand that is **Premium, Authentic, and Joyful**.

## 1. Brand Essence

### 1.1 Mission
To bring the joy of exploration back to travel planning by serving as a knowledgeable, warm, and authentic personal travel companion.

### 1.2 The "Local Guide" Persona
Custour is not just a tool; it is a **Local Friend**.
*   **We are:** Helpful, Flexible, Professional, Warm, Down-to-earth.
*   **We are NOT:** Cold, Robotic, "Tech-bro", Overly Formal.

### 1.3 Voice & Tone
Our voice sounds like a local guide greeting you in Bali: welcoming, respectful, but ready for an adventure.
*   **Vocabulary:** Use words like *Explore, Discover, Journey, Hidden Gems, Authentic, Joy, Ease.*
*   **Tone:**
    *   *Direct but Warm:* "Let's get your trip sorted." (Good) vs "Trip generation complete." (Bad)
    *   *Encouraging:* "You're going to love this hidden beach."

## 2. Visual Identity

### 2.1 The "Tropical Modernity" Concept
Our visual style merges the **Premium quality of a luxury resort** with the **Adventure of a jungle expedition**, all delivered through a slick, modern interface.

### 2.2 Color Palette: "Ocean, Forest & Sand"
We move away from dark/neon clouds to earthly, vibrant tones.

| Use Case | Color Name | Hex Code | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary** | **Deep Ocean Blue** | `#004E64` | Trust, Depth, Premium Headers. |
| **Secondary** | **Forest Green** | `#2E593F` | Nature, Growth, Calm. |
| **Base** | **Warm Sand** | `#F5F1E8` | The "White Paper" replacement. Warmth foundation. |
| **Accent** | **Terracotta / Sunset** | `#D97C56` | Buttons, CTAs, "Joy" moments. |

> [!TIP]
> Use "Warm Sand" as the background for most pages to avoid the harshness of pure white.

### 2.3 Typography
We pair character with clarity.

*   **Headings:** **Plus Jakarta Sans** (Bold, ExtraBold)
    *   *Why:* Geometric but with friendly curves. Modern and approachable.
*   **Body:** **Inter** or **Switzer**
    *   *Why:* Unbeatable legibility for complex itineraries and booking details.

### 2.4 Official Logo: "The Smile Pin"
Our logo embodies the connection between "Location" (Pin) and "Joy" (Smile). It is a clean, monoline symbol that feels drawn by hand—warm, approachable, and professional.

*   **Meaning:** The pin marks the spot, but the smile marks the *experience*. It says, "We're happy to guide you."
*   **Usage:** Use the icon on its own for avatars/favicons, or locked up with the wordmark for headers.

### 2.5 Imagery & Graphics
*   **Photography:** **Abstract Tropical**.
    *   Use macro shots of leaves, ripples in water, or soft sunsets.
    *   Human shots should be candid—sharing a meal, walking a trail. NO posing.
*   **Graphics:** Organic shapes.
    *   Use soft "blobs" and waves in our primary colors to frame content.
    *   Avoid sharp corners; stick to rounded radii (24px+).

---

## 3. Application Examples
*   **Buttons:** Terracotta background, White text, fully rounded pills.
*   **Cards:** White background (on top of Warm Sand), subtle shadow, large rounded corners.
*   **Illustrations:** Line art (thin, organic lines) matching the logo style.
